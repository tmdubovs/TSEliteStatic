    <h2>All times with full video proof will be listed in the rankings.</h2>
    <p class="lead">
        If there is a full video of a time, then it should be on the rankings. There's no doubt the time was achieved. Scrolling, besides the exceptions noted futher on, does not apply and cannot get a time on the ranks.
    </p>

    <h2>No untied World Record will be allowed without complete video proof.</h2>
    <p class="lead">
        All untied World Records must be recorded and the video must be made available to proof mods.  Proof calls will be made periodically and players will be given a full month to make proof of their scores available.  Failue to prove a score before a proof deadline will result in the score being rolled back to a previous score or removed entirely.
    </p>

    <h2>
        No fully unproven tied WR claims will be allowed in the future.
    </h2>
    <p class="lead">
        This is somewhat different from untieds. Full video proof is requried for tied records, with the following exceptions listed below which only require scrolling proof:

    <h2>
        Proof Calls
    </h2>
    <p>
        From time to time, proof call of players may be made. This will be done on an individual by individual basis. Scrolling proof of times may be required, in addition to full videos of certain times.  Players will be given month to provide proof.
    </p>

    <h2>
        What Counts as Full Video Proof
    </h2>
    <p>
        This varies from game to game, and there are certain stages that are exceptions, but in general:
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>TS1</u>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The entire run must be captured, from the "loading" screen to the final display of the score.
        </li>
        <li>
            The only exception is for challenge 1C Dusk of the Dead. In this case, the entire final wave played must be captured along with the screen displaying the final score.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <u>TS2</u>
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The entire run must be captured, from the "loading" screen to the final display of the the score. In the case of old school games, the entire run must be captured and the player's list of high scores shown after the run should also be captured.
        </li>
        <li>
            Exceptions are made for the three Behead the Undead challenges, Fight Off the Living Dead, Sergio's Last Stand, and Day of the Damned. In these cases, the final wave played must captured along with the screen displaying the final score. In the case that the player reaches the final endless wave, or that the last wave reached lasts longer than 5 minutes, such as was the case with world record Fight Off the Living Dead runs, approximately the last two minutes of gameplay should be captured along with the screen displaying the final score.
        </li>
        <li>
            An exception is made for the Old School game Anaconda. Approximately the last one-two minutes of gameplay should be captured along with the list of the player's high scores.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <u>TSFP</u>
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            For arcade and challenges, the entire run must be captured from the announcer countdown to the level end screen at the end of the stage. For arcade stages, the player must clearly show the time/score achieved by going right one menu on the final screen.
        </li>
        <li>
            For story stages, the entire run must be captured. In addition, the section of the player's profile that shows the stage time achieved must be shown after the story stage is completed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Exceptions are made for the Behead the Undead stages, Brain Drain, Rare of Well Done, and Boxing Clever. In these cases, the entire final wave played must be captured along with the level end screen showing the final score. In the case that the player reashes the final endless wave, or the final wave reached lasts longer than five minutes, such as in world record Brain Drain runs, the final two minutes of gameplay should be captured along with the level end screen showing the final score.
        </li>
        <li>
            An exception is made for the challenge Timesplitters Underground. In this case, the last two minutes of gameplay must be captured along with the level end screen showing the final score.
        </li>
        <li>
            An exception is made for the challenge Electro Chimp Discomatic. In this case, the final wave played must be captured along with the level end screen showing the final score.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Players with prior proof issues may only PR through full video proof.
    </h2>
    <p class="lead">
        Players who have been removed from the ranks for cheating can only have times on the ranks that they have a video for. Only full video proof will be acccepted. No scrolling. Former cheaters will also lose control over their times page. Videos of PRs must be shown to a proof mod, and the mod will then edit in times on the rankings.
    </p>

    <h2>
        All times by veteran, long inactive players will remain.
    </h2>
    <p class="lead">
        There are several WRs that were achieved long ago that do not have proper video proof. Under the previous proof policy, these were allowed to be proven by scrolling proof. These times will remain on the ranks. If an inactive player decides to make a comeback, then any new times claimed will fall under the new proof policy. In the unlikely event that an inactive player comes and "unhoards" several new times that they claim were achieved before the new proof policy, the unhoarded times will still fall under the new proof policy and require full video proof.
    </p>





    <p>
        If you deface your score page, submit fake scores,  or remove all of your scores in a deliberate attempt to make the rankings inaccurate then you score page will be locked and any changes rolled back as needed.
