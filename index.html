                <div style="word-wrap:break-word;">There's been a recent discovery of most/all of the stages for TimeSplitters 2 available via unlock codes on the Xbox One, PS4, and PC versions of Homefront: The Revolution.<br /><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/timesplitters/comments/mnkpxh/homefront_the_revolution_timesplitters_2_unlock/">TS2 Homefront Unlock Codes</a><br /><br />This is an extremely cool easter egg and definitely worth checking out if you own Homefront: The Revolution.<br /><br />Regarding high score/speed run submissions, The TimeSplitters Elite will NOT be accepting any submissions from this version of the game.  All TimeSplitters 2 submissions must be from the PlayStation 2, Gamecube, or XBox versions.<br /><br />While it is an incredible easter egg, it is not an official release of the game.  It is also not exactly a perfect port, currently containing a number of game breaking bugs and glitches.  There also the additional issue of the PC version allowing for mouse/keyboard controls while all other versions do not.<br /><br />In the event of an official TimeSplitters/TS2/TSFP remaster ever being released (hopefully!), then brand new rankings would be created on tselite.net to track records for those games.<br /></div>

                <div style="word-wrap:break-word;">A fairly small update was made to the site tonight.  Nothing too crazy.<br /><br />-Updated submission guidelines for TimeSplitters 1 Single Segment<br /><br />-Added story time totals for TimeSplitters 1, TimeSplitters 2 Story, and TimeSplitters: Future Perfect rankings.<br /><br />-Updated trademark owner of TimeSplitters to THQ Nordic<br /><br />-Fixed an issue with displaying scores for Retro Racer where the seconds would have three digits in some cases.</div>

                <div style="word-wrap:break-word;">I was looking through some of the stages on this website and noticed that <a href="https://tselite.net/StageRankings/167">Boxing Clever</a> for TimeSplitters: Future Perfect currently does not have a single video available for it.  That's not very good!<br /><br />I will send via paypal, hmmmmm...let's say $20 USD to anybody who beats the current world record on Boxing Clever and provides a video.  Since I'll be paying actual money for this, I want the full run recorded, start to finish.  Must be done on an actual console, as is the case for any score submitted to this site. <br /><br />To claim the bounty, contact either the tselite support email, support@tselite.net, or contact me in the <a href="https://discord.gg/N5HjybG">TimeSplitters Speedrunning</a> discord.<br /><br /></div>

                <div style="word-wrap:break-word;">While Anemptybox was busy becoming the new TSFP champ, another TS Elite member was busy pushing the limits in TimeSplitters 2 Story Easy.  <a href="https://tselite.net/Player/Overview/1628">TB-303</a> has been picking off one record after another over the last few months, including several united records.  He achieved 5 new records between September 10 and September 18, finishing off with Wild West Easy and becoming the 3rd player in history <b>to hold all 10 Easy records simultaneously.</b>  Let's take a look:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkgfL0Nx2wo">Siberia Easy - 2:04</a><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM8bg4qld04">Chicago Easy - 2:22 (Untied)</a><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7cr-1nmEY4">Notre Dame Easy - 2:29 (Untied)</a><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y81ADgs8irM">Planet X Easy - 2:04</a><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3RMM7KOf7k">NeoTokyo Easy - 4:10 (Untied)</a><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mvazGddDqE">Wild West Easy - 1:07</a><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FBNjUCjp0w">Atom Smasher Easy - 2:57</a><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gphGQLavOwQ">Aztec Easy - 1:53 (Untied)</a><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb34GGPX-Ck">Robot Factory Easy - 3:14</a><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9N6yqFJXeE">Space Station Easy - 3:36</a><br /><br />Great work TB-303!  Perhaps we will be seeing some runs on Normal in the future?  Let's hope!<br /><br /></div>

                <div class="newsTitle">Your New TSFP Champion - Anemptybox!</div>
                <div style="word-wrap:break-word;">If you've been watching the rankings since they've gone back online last April, then have noticed Anemptybox moving up the rankings, quickly moving into 3rd and then 2nd place.  However, a very large point gap separated #1 Phoenix from second place, owing to his absolute dominance of story mode and excellent scores in challenges/arcade.<br /><br />That dominance is no more and it has been an absolute treat watching Anempty box narrow the point gap with several new world records and many quality 97 and 95 point scores.  Let's have a look at the road to 1st place.<br /><br />First off were two new world records on Something to Crow About, using a new strategy for the sphere section:<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzEmUgglLvE">Something to Crow About Easy - 7:18.3</a><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pEiw_ZlawE">Something to Crow About Normal - 7:23.3</a><br /><br />Next was a WR sweep on You Take the Highroad:<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trnpsh17eFw">You Take the Highroad Easy - 4:53.7</a><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFFgfVzOQPM">You Take the Highroad Normal - 4:56.6</a><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3FtHWAHF9c">You Take the Highroad Hard - 5:00.4</a><br /><br />Next was a new WR for Melon Heist, after several improvements:<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwlbAyIwtcM">Melon Heist - 9350</a><br /><br />Next Anemptybox improved all of his Time To Split times, including a new WR on normal:<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-Lwx3ZISy8">Time To Split Normal - 3:22.9</a><br /><br />After that he achieved a WR sweep on The Khallos Express:<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOtcB2Ne7_Q">Khallos Express Easy - 3:47.0</a><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH49Exs5ck8">Khallos Express Normal - 3:53.4</a><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15r7EfGmzHo">Khallos Express Hard = 3:55.5</a><br /><br />Then he completed another(!) story mode sweep by grabbing the WR on Something to Crow About Hard:<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TgqaiW1Bwo">Something to Crow About Hard - 7:27.7</a><br /><br />Next were 97 point scores for all three difficulties on The Russian Connection and Front Loaded.  After that were improvements on What Lies Below (one of his least favorite stages).  Finally, a nice improvement on Oh Shoal-o-Mio took Anemptybox past Phoenix for the top spot on the rankings.<br /><br />That is an incredibly impressive set of scores that were accomplished this Summer.  A huge congrats goes to Anemptybox, the new TSFP Champion!</div>
